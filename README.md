## Example Generated Maps

![LIDAR Map](./images/LIDAR_Map.png)

The image above shows our robot's generated occupancy grid map of the environment using LIDAR data. White areas represent free space, while darker pixels indicate detected obstacles.

![Configuration Space](./images/CSpace.png) 

The image above shows the configuration space after dilating obstacles to account for the robot's physical dimensions. This ensures paths maintain safe distances from obstacles.

## Technical Components

### 1. Mapping System
- LIDAR-based occupancy grid mapping in real-time
- Probabilistic sensor model with grayscale representation
- Map filtering and saving capabilities
- Coordinate transformation from robot to world frame

### 2. Configuration Space Computation
- Dilation of obstacles using convolution
- Binary thresholding for obstacle classification
- Ensures planned paths keep safe distance from obstacles

### 3. Path Planning
- Implementation of graph search algorithms (A* or Dijkstra's)
- Conversion between world coordinates and map coordinates
- Generation of waypoints for robot navigation
- Visualization of planned paths

### 4. Feedback Controller
- Proportional control for waypoint navigation
- Error calculation for distance and heading
- Smooth velocity adjustments
- Wheel speed normalization

## Operation Modes

### 1. Manual Mode
- Direct control of robot through keyboard input
- Real-time mapping during manual exploration
- Saving/loading map functionality

### 2. Planner Mode
- Loads saved map from disk
- Computes configuration space
- Plans path between specified start and goal points
- Saves planned path for autonomous execution

### 3. Autonomous Mode
- Loads pre-planned path
- Navigates through waypoints using feedback controller
- Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance

### 4. Pick and Place Mode
- Advanced mode combining navigation with manipulation
- Path planning to reach objects
- Robot arm control for pick and place operations

## Implementation Details

The system implements a complete perception-planning-action loop:

1. **Perception**: LIDAR data is processed to create and update an occupancy grid map
2. **Planning**: Configuration space is computed and paths are planned using search algorithms
3. **Action**: Robot navigates through waypoints using a feedback controller

The map is represented as a 360Ã—360 grid corresponding to a 12Ã—12 meter environment, with each pixel representing a 3.33Ã—3.33 cm area.

## Usage Instructions

1. Select operation mode by modifying the `mode` variable:
   ```python
   mode = 'manual'      # For manual control and mapping
   mode = 'planner'     # For path planning
   mode = 'autonomous'  # For autonomous navigation
   mode = 'picknplace'  # For pick and place operations
